# Bug Hunter Series â€“ A QA Engineering Portfolio  
Created by Dylan Joseph Best

Welcome to my **Bug Hunter Series**, a personal Quality Assurance (QA) portfolio where I test open-source or publicly accessible web applications and document real-world bugs using structured, detailed reporting. This project showcases my passion for quality, attention to detail, and the ability to identify usability issues and functional errors in modern software interfaces.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my hands-on skills in manual testing, bug tracking, and user experience analysis. As a QA Analyst, I want to show how I:

- Approach web application testing from a user-centric perspective  
- Identify both visual/UI and functional bugs  
- Record reproducible steps, expected vs. actual results, and severity levels  
- Create clear and professional QA documentation
